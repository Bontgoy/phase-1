# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

Some of the time management and productivity ideas I read about include focused meditation, the pomodoro technique, focusing on the smallest parts of a project, and creating habits out of the things I want to do or achieve.

Time boxing is choosing a set length of time and working within that limit. When the time is up, you stop working and review your progress. During Phase 0, I can use this technique to train myself to review my work and take breaks at set intervals.

Currently, I manage my time by only working when I feel productive. When I start to feel my mind wandering I take 10-20 minute breaks. This strategy has made me happier at work, but I don’t know if at the end of the day I am a more productive person because of it. I also occasionally meditate, do yoga, or swim to clear my mind and focus.

During Phase 0 I will try out different techniques for time management. First I will try time boxing, but if that doesn’t work I will try some of the other techniques I read about. I will also focus on working through projects from their smallest points. When I don’t understand something, I will try to break it down and work on each part for short burst of time.


# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

The shell is what we use to give commands to the operating system without the use of graphical user interfaces. Bash is the program that interprets the typed commands and executes them.

The most challenging thing for me in going through this material was figuring out how to move a file from one place to another and using the popd and pushd commands. However, I eventually successfully used all of the commands.

In my opinion, the most important commands to know are ls, grep, mkdir, touch and mv. With these, you can make files and directories, see what is inside files, move them around, and search for specific phrases.

pwd —> stands for “print working directory,” use this to figure out where you are in the hierarchy of directories

ls —> lists the contents of the directory you are currently in

mv —> rename a file or move a file to a different location

cd —> change directory

../ —> points to the directory the current directory is inside of. type cd .. to move to the previous directory

touch —> creates an empty file

mkdir —> creates a new directory

less —> view data from a file page by page

rmdir —> remove/delete a directory

rm —> remove/delete a file

help —> use this to search for information about commands
