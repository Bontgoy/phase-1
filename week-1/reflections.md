# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

Some of the time management and productivity ideas I read about include focused meditation, the pomodoro technique, focusing on the smallest parts of a project, and creating habits out of the things I want to do or achieve.

Time boxing is choosing a set length of time and working within that limit. When the time is up, you stop working and review your progress. During Phase 0, I can use this technique to train myself to review my work and take breaks at set intervals.

Currently, I manage my time by only working when I feel productive. When I start to feel my mind wandering I take 10-20 minute breaks. This strategy has made me happier at work, but I don’t know if at the end of the day I am a more productive person because of it. I also occasionally meditate, do yoga, or swim to clear my mind and focus.

During Phase 0 I will try out different techniques for time management. First I will try time boxing, but if that doesn’t work I will try some of the other techniques I read about. I will also focus on working through projects from their smallest points. When I don’t understand something, I will try to break it down and work on each part for short burst of time.


# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

The shell is what we use to give commands to the operating system without the use of graphical user interfaces. Bash is the program that interprets the typed commands and executes them.

The most challenging thing for me in going through this material was figuring out how to move a file from one place to another and using the popd and pushd commands. However, I eventually successfully used all of the commands.

In my opinion, the most important commands to know are ls, grep, mkdir, touch and mv. With these, you can make files and directories, see what is inside files, move them around, and search for specific phrases.

pwd —> stands for “print working directory,” use this to figure out where you are in the hierarchy of directories

ls —> lists the contents of the directory you are currently in

mv —> rename a file or move a file to a different location

cd —> change directory

../ —> points to the directory the current directory is inside of. type cd .. to move to the previous directory

touch —> creates an empty file

mkdir —> creates a new directory

less —> view data from a file page by page

rmdir —> remove/delete a directory

rm —> remove/delete a file

help —> use this to search for information about commands


# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

### How to create a repository:
1. Login to GitHub
2. Click the “+” in the top right corner of the screen next to your  picture
3. Click “New Repository” in the drop down list
4. On the new screen, type a name for your repository
5. Choose whether to allow anyone to see the repository or to make it private
6. Click “Create Repository” at the bottom of the screen

### How to fork a repository:
1. Go to the URL of the repository you want to fork
2. Click “Fork” in the top right corner beneath your picture
3. The page that loads contains the forked repository, nested within your personal GitHub account

### How to clone a repository:
1. Open the terminal on your computer
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository
3. Type: git clone [URL OF THE DEPOSITORY YOU WANT TO CLONE]

You fork a repository instead of creating a new one because then you can make changes and merge the fork back into the main body of code later.

I didn’t have any huge problems setting up git or GitHub. The way they work together reminds me of Google Drive. In setting them up, I learned how to better navigate my terminal and how to search and find projects on GitHub.
