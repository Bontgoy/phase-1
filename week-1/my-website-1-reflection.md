# 1.6 Your Website

##### 1. Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

http://alran.github.io/

##### 2. Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

- To create a repository on GitHub, click the "+" on the top right corner of the page after you have logged in. Select "Create Repository" in the drop-down list. Select a name for the repository, choose the licenses, and select a sharing setting, then click "Create Repository"
- To clone the repository to your local computer, copy the URL given on the repository page after it has been created. In your computer terminal, navigate to the folder where you want to clone the repository. Then, type **git clone [URL]**.

##### 3. Describe what open source means.

Open source is code that is freely available for others to review or modify as they see fit.

##### 4. What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I think all code should be Open Source so that we can all build off of each other. However, it would be very difficult for anyone to monetize on software products. The investment in building a company to create software would be harder to justify if anyone can just copy the end result and sell it at a lower price.

##### 5. Assess the importance of using licenses.

A license tells others what they can and cannot do with your original code. Licenses are important because they allow you to have some control over how your code is used. You can choose to be protective or open about what you create.

##### 6. What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

Now that I have created multiple git commits and pull requests, I feel much more comfortable using them. I was confused at first about how to move around between branches or from a branch to the master. I was also confused about what "checkout" meant. However, after doing it so many time, it makes more sense to me.

##### 7. Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I read a lot of the help articles on GitHub.
