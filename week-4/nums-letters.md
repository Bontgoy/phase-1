###Release 1: Summarize

#####1. What does puts do?

Puts prints the output on a new line in the console. It returns nil and does not pass any information on.

#####2. What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a whole number with no decimal point. A float has decimal points.

#####3. What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

In an equation involving integers, the result is rounded down to the next lowest whole number. For example if 11 is divided by 3, the result will be 3, not 3.66. The best way to understand this is to imagine using division in a real life situation, where the objects in question cannot be split up. For example, I have 11 meeting slots on my calendar and three people want to meet with me as much as they can. What is the average number of times each of the 11 people will be able to meet with me? The answer is 3. They cannot share a session or split a session between two people.

###Release 2: Try it!

###Release 7: Reflect

#####1. How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

Ruby handles addition, subtraction, multiplication and division similar to a calculator. However, unlike a calculator, if the numbers being acted upon are integers, it will not give a float as an output.

#####2. What is the difference between integers and floats?

An integer is a whole number without a decimal point. A float has a decimal point.

#####3. What is the difference between integer and float division?

In integer division, the output is rounded down to the nearest whole number. In float division, the output can have a decimal point.

#####4. What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

Strings are combinations of letters, numbers, and other characters in a set order, like a sentence. You might use them to present words, sentences, or paragraphs. Or you might use them anytime you want to keep elements together in a certain order

#####5. What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

A local variable is a variable that is tied to a specific local scope. For example, a variable that is created within a function is only usable within that function. You cannot call it outside the function.

#####6. How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

This challenge was a good review of the basics. I don't remember anything!
