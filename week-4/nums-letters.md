###Release 1: Summarize

#####1. What does puts do?

Puts prints the output on a new line in the console. It returns nil and does not pass any information on.

#####2. What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a whole number with no decimal point. A float has decimal points.

#####3. What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

In an equation involving integers, the result is rounded down to the next lowest whole number. For example if 11 is divided by 3, the result will be 3, not 3.66. The best way to understand this is to imagine using division in a real life situation, where the objects in question cannot be split up. For example, I have 11 meeting slots on my calendar and three people want to meet with me as much as they can. What is the average number of times each of the 11 people will be able to meet with me? The answer is 3. They cannot share a session or split a session between two people.
