##### What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

- Information Gathering
- Planning
- Design
- Development
- Testing & Delivery
- Maintenance

##### What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

My site will be a basic introduction to who I am with some links to projects or articles I have worked on. Its primary goal will be to push users to contact me.

##### What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience should be interested in contacting me. Therefore, they should probably be interested in developing world tech, work for a technology company, or have some other connection with projects I have worked on. My site will have links to my social media pages and articles I have written. The people visiting my site should already have some idea of who I am.

##### What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

I want my users to come to my site and send me a message. I don't want them to see too much information about me directly on the site. They can link to my LinkedIn or Twitter accounts, but I don't want them to read too much content. The site should push users to send me a message, perhaps with a message box.

##### What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

- Design that is focused on user experience is more likely to lead to a return user or customer
- Situations that could benefit from UX design include: complex systems, start-ups, projects with "ok" budgets, projects with longer timeframes
- User experiences vary, so user experience design must be tailored to each individual experience
- UX is difficult to assess with traditional metrics
- UX designers can use A/B testing, user surveys, and analytics software to check which design format works best for users

##### What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

User experience design is when you develop a product with the user's experience in mind. How will the user interact with this product? Does the current set up of the product maximize usability, accessability, and user happiness?

##### Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

It took me a long time to get the image of my site map to show up properly. I could easily make the image appear using HTML, but for some reason, not using markdown.
