##### What is a wireframe?

A wireframe is a blueprint that represents the skeletal framework of your website.

##### What are the benefits of wireframing?

Wireframes are helpful because they force you to consider the relationships between different parts of the website and the overall functionality. You can do all the thought work of what the site will do before putting time and effort into actual design.

##### Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

I enjoyed looking at other websites for inspiration for my wireframe, but it was difficult to finally settle on one design.

##### Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I revised my wireframe a few times to try different arrangements.

##### What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

- What do I want users to do when they visit the site? Which actions are most important?
- How do I want users to feel about me, the subject of the site?
- How much detail do I want to include?
- How can I make the site as to-the-point and functional as possible?

To answer these questions, I looked at a lot of sample websites and read articles about web design.

##### Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

I enjoyed researching how to make a good wireframe and looking at sample sites. It was a bit tedious actually building my wireframe but I still enjoyed it.
