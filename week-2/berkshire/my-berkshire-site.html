<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
I have been working on my own site in the solo challenge, so this was a good review.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
HTML5 elements make a lot of sense. They are more clear than using "div" for everything. It was pretty easy to find descriptions of the different elements using Google.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I think I did a good job of keeping to best practices...

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
It seems strange to me that HTML and CSS are separate languages. They should be combined in some way. It is difficult to have to switch between looking at CSS code and HTML. I would like to see everything for a particular section in one place. The good thing about HTML is that it forces you to keep the structure simple.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Always add the closing tag when you add the start tag. Remember to nest. Give IDs to sections so styling with CSS is easier later.
