1. How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?


2. How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

You can simply change the CSS code on the DOM to resize elements (using the height and width properties).

3. What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?

Margin refers to the area outside the space of the object. Padding refers to the area inside the space of the object, between whatever is written and the edge of the object. Border is what goes around the edges of the object.

4. What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

This challenge was a little bit hard to complete as a pair since it involved a lot of very simple trial and error with the source code. The person driving can quickly click and unclick boxes to see what happens, faster than the navigator can suggest it. Also, my internet connection was not good during the challenge and this made everything drag out.
